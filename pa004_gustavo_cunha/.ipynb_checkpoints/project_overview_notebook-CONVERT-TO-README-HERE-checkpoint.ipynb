    "## What is the business problem the company is facing?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Insurance All is a health insurance company and its products team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product, automobile insurance, for its health insurance clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similar to its health insurance, customers of this new insurance plan would have to pay an annual plan to be insured by Insurance All in case of an eventual car accident or damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Last year, Insurance All surveyed approximately 380.000 clients on their purchasing interests in this new automobile insurance. All clients in this survey had an 'interested' or 'not interested' response to this new car insurance product and every answer was stored in a database alongside other information from its clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The product team chose 127.000 new clients that didn't answer the last survey to be offered the new automobile insurance product. The products team will make these offers by phone call, however, they can make only 20.000 phone calls in the campaign.    \n",

    "    In this business context, you were as a data science consultant to build a model that predicts if a client would be (or would not be) interested in the automobile insurance product.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With this model, the products team expects to prioritize clients that would be interested in the new product and so optimize sales campaigns by making phone calls just for the interested clients.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As a final consultant product, you have to make a report with the following analyses:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. Top insights about the most relevant features of automobile insurance interested clients \n",
    "    \n",
    "        2. Making 20.000 phone calls, what percentage of interested clients the sales team will get in contact with?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        3. If the sales team expand its capacity to make 40.000 phone calls, what is the percentage of interested clients the sales team will get in contact with?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        4. How many phone calls do the sales team has to make in order to contact 80% of automobile insurance interested clients?"
